Introduction
Web service is a service delivered over web.
Web->Business->Data
W3C definition->Software system designed to support interoperable machine to machine interaction over
a network.
3 Keys:
	designed for machine to machine applicatione 
	shound be interoperable, not platform dependent
	allow communication over network; jar
How data exchange between application?
	input is a request
	output is a response
Should be platform indipendent:
	request response it will be indipendent too
	The format is XML or
	Json:Javascript object notation used on frontend
How know the format of request and response
	Service definition:
		request/respons format; Request Structure; response structure; endpoint #how to  call where is avaible
Terminology:
	Request is the input
	response is the outpunt
	format of the request response
	Service Provider #web service
	service Consumer # consume the web service
	Service definition is the contract bitween apps.
	Transport: How the service is call. 2 format
		HTTP 
		MQ  # communication over the queue
Web service groups:
	Soap :Simple object access protocoll; Specifiches for constructing web service use XML for exchange
		Define e specifich request and response structure envelope # Head body;
		Soap define format and dont put limit to transport HTTP or MQ
		Service definition : WSDL: web service definition language.
			define the enpoint; operation; request and response structure
	Rest # architeture aproach, restriction on format
		REST: rappresentant state transfere Roy filding
		Use HTTP interaction browser/server 
		Resource
			URI Uniform resource identifier
			Different representations: XML, HTML, JSON (most useed)
		No restiction on data format, uso only HTTP, no service definition. WADL, Swagger
